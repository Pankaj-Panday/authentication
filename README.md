# basic-authentication
This repo implements basic authentication using **mongoDB** for storing username and password, and using **cookies for handling session**.

## NOTE
- **passwords are stored in plaintext** in mongoDB.
- Using `cookie-parser` to parse the cookies.
- Using `nano-id` to generate session IDs which will be sent with cookie to the client browser.
- Using built in **Map** data structure for handling session.
- It just shows how sessions work at very high level, it doesn't implement full functionality of sessions or have proper authentication system.
